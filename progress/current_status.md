## Project Overview
Building a data collection module for Heimdal that fetches and stores data from social media, Google Trends, and SEO platforms. The module will automatically fetch relevant information daily and store it in a PostgreSQL database.

## Current Status
- ✅ Project initialization phase
- ✅ Setting up project structure and documentation
- ✅ Designing system architecture
- ✅ Implementation phase
- ✅ Testing phase
- ⏳ Deployment preparation phase

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created instructions folder with project requirements
- ✅ Set up scripts to read instructions on startup
- ✅ Created progress tracking system
- ✅ Designed database schema for PostgreSQL
- ✅ Created database models for all required tables
- ✅ Implemented database connection module with SQLite fallback for testing
- ✅ Created data collectors for all platforms:
  - ✅ Twitter collector
  - ✅ Facebook collector
  - ✅ TikTok collector
  - ✅ Google Trends collector
- ✅ Implemented FastAPI endpoints for data access:
  - ✅ GET /api/data/trends
  - ✅ GET /api/data/engagement
  - ✅ GET /api/data/seo
  - ✅ POST /api/data/fetch
- ✅ Set up automated data collection via scheduler
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Successfully tested the application:
  - ✅ Database initialization
  - ✅ API endpoints
  - ✅ Data collection process
  - ✅ Data retrieval

## Current Tasks
- 🔄 Preparing for production deployment
- 🔄 Creating additional documentation for users

## Next Steps
1. Set up a PostgreSQL database instance for production
2. Obtain API keys for all social media platforms
3. Configure the .env file with all required credentials
4. Deploy the application to a production environment
5. Set up monitoring for the data collection process
6. Create a simple web dashboard to visualize the collected data (optional)
7. Add unit tests to ensure system reliability (optional)

## Issues/Challenges
- Need to obtain API keys for social media platforms
- Need to set up a PostgreSQL database instance for production
- Need to decide on a hosting environment for the application

## Notes
The project has been successfully implemented and tested in a development environment using SQLite. The system is collecting mock data from Google Trends and storing it in the database, and the API endpoints are working correctly.

Key files and directories:
- `heimdal_data/database/`: Contains database models and connection logic
- `heimdal_data/collectors/`: Contains data collectors for all platforms
- `heimdal_data/api/`: Contains FastAPI endpoints
- `heimdal_data/main.py`: Entry point for the application
- `heimdal_data/.env`: Environment variables configuration

To start the application:
```bash
python heimdal_data/main.py
```

To trigger a manual data collection:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/data/fetch
```

To retrieve collected data:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/data/seo | python -m json.tool
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/data/trends | python -m json.tool
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/data/engagement | python -m json.tool
```
